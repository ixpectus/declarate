## CI/CD Pipeline Flow

### On Pull Request:
1. Code quality checks (formatting, linting, security)
2. Unit tests across multiple Go versions
3. Integration tests with services
4. Compatibility testing on multiple platforms
5. Coverage reporting
6. Security vulnerability scanning

### On Merge to Main:
1. All PR checks (repeated)
2. Full test suite execution
3. Documentation checks
4. Release preparation (if tagged)

### On Git Tag (v*):
1. Full test suite
2. Multi-platform binary builds
3. Changelog generation
4. GitHub release creation
5. Asset upload

### Daily:
1. Security vulnerability scanning
2. Dependency checks
3. Code quality verification

## Benefits

1. **Quality Assurance**: Every change is automatically tested and validated
2. **Security**: Continuous vulnerability monitoring and dependency updates
3. **Consistency**: Standardized development environment and processes
4. **Automation**: Reduced manual work for releases and maintenance
5. **Transparency**: Clear visibility into build status and quality metrics
6. **Collaboration**: Structured templates and guidelines for contributors

## Next Steps

After merging this branch:

1. **Repository Settings**: Configure branch protection rules
2. **Secrets**: Add any required secrets (e.g., Codecov token)
3. **Notifications**: Set up appropriate notification preferences
4. **Team Access**: Configure team permissions and reviewers
5. **Documentation**: Update main README with CI/CD badges and status

## Usage

### For Maintainers:
```bash
# Create a release
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
# GitHub Actions will handle the rest
```

### For Contributors:
```bash
# Before submitting PR
make fmt lint test-cover
```

### For Development:
```bash
# Set up development environment
make deps-dev
make run-postgres
make test
```

This implementation provides a solid foundation for maintaining code quality, security, and automated delivery for the Declarate project.
